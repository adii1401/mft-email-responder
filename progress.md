# Aditya's AI Journey

## Personal Context
- Name: Aditya Kumar Gupta
- Current: Cognizant, 6.7 LPA, MFT/EDI/Seeburger team
- Goal: AI Automation Engineer, 15-18 LPA by Feb 2027

## Project 1: MFT Support Email Responder ✅ COMPLETE
- GitHub: github.com/adii1401/mft-email-responder
- Live: https://mft-email-responder-gzxs4yes6ut8dvdruafyue.streamlit.app/
- Stack: Python, Groq, LLaMA 3.3, Streamlit, ChromaDB, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, RAG, Microsoft Graph API, MSAL, SQLite

## What's Built
- RAG pipeline with past emails as context ✅
- Reads PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT docs ✅
- Streamlit multipage UI ✅
- Deployed on Streamlit Cloud ✅
- Dummy MFT docs (TP master list, rules, escalation guide) ✅
- ChromaDB vector database (proper semantic search) ✅
- Text chunking with overlap (500 words, 50 overlap) ✅
- all-MiniLM-L6-v2 semantic embeddings ✅
- Top-K semantic retrieval (only relevant chunks sent to LLM) ✅
- Retrieved context viewer ✅
- Secrets management (.env excluded, Streamlit secrets used) ✅
- Persistent ChromaDB via PersistentClient ✅
- 30 past emails indexed in ChromaDB as searchable vectors ✅
- Unified semantic search across emails + docs ✅
- Pinned dependencies (chromadb==1.5.1, Python 3.13 compatible) ✅
- Confidence scores with color-coded badges (🟢🟡🔴) ✅
- Low confidence warning banner (<40% match) ✅
- Microsoft Graph API integration (OAuth device flow via MSAL) ✅
- Auto-fetch unread emails from Outlook inbox ✅
- Semi-automatic flow — generate, review, one-click send ✅
- Editable reply before sending (human in the loop) ✅
- Auto CC extraction + Job Owner auto-identified from TP master list ✅
- Email marked as read after reply sent ✅
- Follow-up tracker with SQLite + SLA deadlines + overdue alerts ✅
- SQL console for raw queries against follow-ups DB ✅
- Architecture diagram in README (Mermaid) ✅

## Day Log

|-----|--------------|
| Day 1 | Project setup, Groq + LLaMA integration, basic UI |
| Day 2 | RAG with past emails, doc readers (PDF/DOCX/XLSX/TXT), deployed |
| Day 3 | ChromaDB integration, semantic chunking, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings, redeployed |
| Day 4 | PersistentClient, fixed collection scoping bugs, skip-if-loaded logic |
| Day 5 | 30 emails as vectors, unified semantic search, pinned dependencies, verified on cloud |
| Day 6 | Confidence scores, Graph API OAuth, auto-fetch, semi-auto send, CC extraction, Job Owner auto-CC |
| Day 7 | README + architecture diagram, merged to main, follow-up tracker, SQLite, SQL console |

## Next Steps
- [ ] Start Project 2
- [ ] LinkedIn post about Project 1

## Long Term Vision
Auto-read emails from Outlook → generate reply using RAG + ChromaDB → CC Job Owner → track follow-ups
