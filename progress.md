# Aditya's AI Journey

## Personal Context
- Name: Aditya Kumar Gupta
- Current: Cognizant, 6.7 LPA, MFT/EDI/Seeburger team
- Goal: AI Automation Engineer, 15-18 LPA by Feb 2027

## Project: MFT Support Email Responder
- GitHub: github.com/adii1401/mft-email-responder
- Live: https://mft-email-responder-gzxs4yes6ut8dvdruafyue.streamlit.app/
- Stack: Python, Groq, LLaMA 3.3, Streamlit, ChromaDB, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, RAG, Microsoft Graph API, MSAL

## What's Built
- RAG pipeline with past emails as context ✅
- Reads PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT docs ✅
- Streamlit UI ✅
- Deployed on Streamlit Cloud ✅
- Dummy MFT docs (TP master list, rules, escalation guide) ✅
- ChromaDB vector database (proper semantic search) ✅
- Text chunking with overlap (500 words, 50 overlap) ✅
- all-MiniLM-L6-v2 semantic embeddings ✅
- Top-K semantic retrieval (only relevant chunks sent to LLM) ✅
- Retrieved context viewer (debug expander in UI) ✅
- Secrets management (.env excluded, Streamlit secrets used) ✅
- Persistent ChromaDB via PersistentClient (survives restarts) ✅
- 30 past emails indexed in ChromaDB as searchable vectors ✅
- Emails + docs retrieved together via unified semantic search ✅
- Pinned dependencies (chromadb==1.5.1, Python 3.13 compatible) ✅
- RAG verified end-to-end on Streamlit Cloud ✅
- Confidence scores with color-coded badges (🟢🟡🔴) on every retrieved chunk ✅
- Low confidence warning banner (<40% match) ✅
- Microsoft Graph API integration (OAuth device flow via MSAL) ✅
- Auto-fetch unread emails from Outlook inbox ✅
- Semi-automatic flow — generate reply, review, one-click send ✅
- Editable reply before sending (human in the loop) ✅
- Auto CC extraction — detects CC emails from reply and sends automatically ✅
- Job Owner auto-identified from TP master list and CC'd in reply ✅
- Email marked as read after reply sent ✅
- Two-tab UI — Outlook Auto mode + Manual paste mode ✅

## Day Log
| Day | What was done |
|-----|--------------|
| Day 1 | Project setup, Groq + LLaMA integration, basic UI |
| Day 2 | RAG with past emails, doc readers (PDF/DOCX/XLSX/TXT), deployed |
| Day 3 | ChromaDB integration, semantic chunking, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings, redeployed |
| Day 4 | Switched to PersistentClient, fixed collection scoping bugs, skip-if-loaded logic, stable cold starts |
| Day 5 | 30 emails loaded into ChromaDB as vectors, unified semantic search across emails + docs, pinned dependencies, verified on Streamlit Cloud |
| Day 6 | Confidence scores with badges + low-confidence warning, Microsoft Graph API OAuth, auto-fetch Outlook inbox, semi-auto send flow, CC extraction, Job Owner auto-CC'd |
| Day 7 | Merge feature/graph-api to main, AI-generated README with architecture diagram, refactor to production folder structure |

## Next Steps
- [ ] Merge feature/graph-api → main
- [ ] Update README with architecture diagram (Mermaid)
- [ ] Refactor to production structure (src/, config/, data/)
- [ ] Plan and start Project 2

## Long Term Vision
Auto-read emails from Outlook → fetch BIS status → 
generate reply using RAG + ChromaDB → CC Job Owner → track follow-ups
